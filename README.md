# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Collection of 14 Reinforcement Learning course homeworks covering foundations, value-based, policy-based, actor-critic, model-based, bandits, exploration, imitation &amp; inverse RL, offline, multi-agent, hierarchical, and meta-RL. Each with notebooks, questions, and solutions.


### 1. [Introduction to RL](01_Introduction_to_RL/)

This homework introduces the fundamentals of reinforcement learning through practical exercises. It involves solving predefined environments (e.g., CartPole, FrozenLake, Taxi) using PPO and DQN from Stable Baselines3, and designing a custom 4Ã—4 GridWorld environment in Gymnasium. A short Pygame tutorial is also included to demonstrate environment creation from scratch.
